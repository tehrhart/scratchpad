Dumping ground for random code and other things that I've worked on that I'm sharing on the Interwebz (e.g cat pics)

Current contents:

* **beesting_clean.py** - Demonstrates Man-on-the-Side (MOTS) attack technique against unencrypted HTTP sessions. 
* **dhcp_vlan_checker.py** - Sends DHCP request packets tagged with all possible VLAN IDs to identify IP ranges and presense of VLANs when sent from a span port.
* **sat_coverage_finder.py** - Used to find the most recent available satellite imagery for a list of targets via the SentinelHub and Skywatch APIs
* **Sat_Coverage_Finder.ipynb** - iPython notebook version of satellite imagery finder. Can be run directly from Google Colab online.
