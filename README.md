Dumping ground for random code and other things that I've worked on that I'm sharing on the Interwebz (e.g cat pics)

Current contents:

* **beesting_clean.py** - Demonstrates Man-on-the-Side (MOTS) attack technique against unencrypted HTTP sessions. 
* **dhcp_vlan_checker.py** - Sends DHCP request packets tagged with all possible VLAN IDs to identify IP ranges and presense of VLANs when sent from a span port.
